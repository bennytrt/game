this is a game 100% made in python but github says 63% HTML 34.8% TeX and 2.2% python but believe me its 100% python


to install its reccomended to create a folder and install it into that folder
or just download the game folder!

future updates ----------
a ui (or some sort of ui) 
ability to change the controls 
ability to change the volume and music
if the ui is implemented succesfully than start screen music
a game intro (like in games)
diffrent levels
